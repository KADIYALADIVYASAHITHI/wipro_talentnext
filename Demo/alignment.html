    <h2>Different Alignments</h2>
    <p class="left">This is a paragraph aligned to the left.</p>
    <p class="center">This is a paragraph aligned to the center.</p>
    <p class="right">This is a paragraph aligned to the right.</p>
    <p class="justify">
        This is a paragraph with justified alignment. It will stretch the lines so that each line has equal width, and the left and right margins are aligned. This is often used for a clean, block-like appearance.
